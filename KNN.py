                     You can use whatever you want to do it
                     For Python 3 the simplest option would be to use 
                     `multiprocessing.Pool` (but don't use `multiprocessing.dummy.Pool` here)
                     You may try use `joblib` but you will most likely encounter an error, 
                     that you will need to google up (and eventually it will work slowly)

                     For Python 2 I also suggest using `multiprocessing.Pool` 
                     You will need to use a hint from this blog 
                     http://qingkaikong.blogspot.ru/2016/12/python-parallel-method-in-class.html
                     I could not get `joblib` working at all for this code 
                     (but in general `joblib` is very convenient)
